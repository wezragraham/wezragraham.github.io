        I am an Edmonton based multimedia artist and software developer. I graduated from NAIT in 2023, 
        and am currently working on developing a digital board game for a local company. Check out my 'Links' page for some examples of my work!
        I would love to help you build an engaging interactive experience, write a jingle for you, or design a poster for your next event.
